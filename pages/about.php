        <p>Mingle came up with the idea for the company and does 50% of the stuff with the website. Since age 7, his dad, a software programmer, taught him how to program, starting with C and moving to C++, Java, and more object-oriented programming languages. Since then, he has learned over 10 languages!</p>

        <p>Walker bought the 3D printer and does the other 50% of the stuff with the website. He likes to use the terminal and solve Rubik's cubes, with a 30 second average solve. He also used the terminal to write this very sentence! Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://walkerwhitehouse.com/">his website</a> to learn more!</p>
